# AWS RDS Snapshot Report Generator

This bash script generates a comprehensive CSV report of manual RDS database snapshots in your AWS account.

## Description

The script fetches information about all manual RDS database snapshots and outputs the data in CSV format. It provides detailed information about each snapshot including creation times, storage details, encryption status, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

1. **AWS CLI** - Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface
   ```bash
   # Install AWS CLI (if not already installed)
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
   unzip awscliv2.zip
   sudo ./aws/install
   ```

2. **jq** - Command-line JSON processor
   ```bash
   # On Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install jq
   
   # On CentOS/RHEL
   sudo yum install jq
   
   # On macOS
   brew install jq
   ```

3. **AWS Credentials** - Configure your AWS credentials
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x rds_snapshot_report.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./rds_snapshot_report.sh
   ```

3. Redirect output to a file:
   ```bash
   ./rds_snapshot_report.sh > rds_snapshots_report.csv
   ```

## Output Format

The script generates a CSV file with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Snapshot Name | The identifier of the DB snapshot |
| Engine Version | The version of the database engine |
| DB Instance or Cluster | The DB instance identifier |
| Snapshot Creation Time | When the snapshot was created |
| DB Instance Created Time | When the original DB instance was created |
| Status | Current status of the snapshot |
| Progress | Percentage completion (for in-progress snapshots) |
| VPC | VPC ID where the snapshot resides |
| Snapshot Type | Type of snapshot (manual) |
| Allocated Storage (GiB) | Storage allocated to the snapshot |
| Storage Type | Type of storage (gp2, gp3, io1, etc.) |
| AZ | Availability Zone |
| Owner | Master username |
| Port | Database port number |
| Encrypted | Whether the snapshot is encrypted |
| Timezone | Database timezone |
| Engine | Database engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) |
| Snapshot DB Time | Database time when snapshot was taken |

## Example Output

```csv
Snapshot Name,Engine Version,DB Instance or Cluster,Snapshot Creation Time,DB Instance Created Time,Status,Progress,VPC,Snapshot Type,Allocated Storage (GiB),Storage Type,AZ,Owner,Port,Encrypted,Timezone,Engine,Snapshot DB Time
"mydb-snapshot-2024","8.0.35","mydb-instance","2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z","2024-01-01T09:00:00.000Z","available","100","vpc-12345678","manual","20","gp2","us-east-1a","admin","3306","true","UTC","mysql","2024-01-15T10:29:45.000Z"
```

## Features

- âœ… Fetches all manual RDS snapshots
- âœ… Comprehensive snapshot information
- âœ… CSV format for easy data analysis
- âœ… Error handling for missing dependencies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AWS CLI not found**
   ```
   Error: AWS CLI not installed. Aborting.
   ```
   Solution: Install AWS CLI using the prerequisites section above.

2. **jq not found**
   ```
   Error: jq not installed. Aborting.
   ```
   Solution: Install jq using the prerequisites section above.

3. **AWS credentials not configured**
   ```
   Error: Unable to locate credentials
   ```
   Solution: Configure AWS credentials using `aws configure`.

4. **Permission denied**
   ```
   Error: An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the DescribeDBSnapshots operation
   ```
   Solution: Ensure your AWS user/role has the necessary RDS read permissions.

## Required AWS Permissions

Your AWS user or role needs the following permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds:DescribeDBSnapshots"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Notes

- The script processes manual snapshots in the default AWS region configured in your AWS CLI
- To process snapshots from a specific region, set the AWS_REGION environment variable or use the --region flag
- Times are displayed in ISO 8601 format (UTC)
- Fields with no data are marked as "N/A"

If your RDS snapshot has an allocated storage of 100 GB, here's how you calculate the monthly storage cost:

ðŸ“Œ AWS Snapshot Storage Pricing
Manual RDS snapshot storage is charged at approx $0.095 per GB-month (in most AWS regions).

This is a monthly recurring cost until the snapshot is deleted.

The cost is based on allocated storage, not actual data used.

ðŸ§® Cost Calculation Formula
bash
Copy
Edit
Snapshot Cost = Allocated Storage (in GB) Ã— Rate per GB per Month
So, for 100 GB:

bash
Copy
Edit
100 GB Ã— $0.095 = $9.50 per month
ðŸ’¡ Additional Notes:
If the snapshot is incremental, AWS still charges based on the total allocated storage size for manual snapshots (i.e., full snapshot size counts).

If you have multiple snapshots of the same DB, the incremental storage cost may be lower, but AWS charges based on total storage across all snapshots â€” so deleting older ones helps reduce this.

ðŸ“Š Example Table
Allocated Storage	Monthly Cost (@ $0.095/GB)
10 GB	$0.95
50 GB	$4.75
100 GB	$9.50
500 GB	$47.50
1 TB (1024 GB)	$97.28


âœ… Step 1: Understand RDS Snapshot Storage Costs
ðŸ“Œ Snapshot Pricing:
Manual Snapshots are charged (automated snapshots are free only up to the DB size).

$0.095 per GB-month (for most regions) for snapshot storage (pricing may vary slightly by region and DB engine).

Snapshots are incremental, so only changes from the previous snapshot are stored â€” but the first full snapshot is always the largest.

Use this formula:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Total Snapshot Storage (in GB) Ã— $0.095 per GB-month = Monthly Cost
You can estimate GB per snapshot using:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws rds describe-db-snapshots --query 'DBSnapshots[*].{ID:DBSnapshotIdentifier, Size:AllocatedStorage}' --output table
